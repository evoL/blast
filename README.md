Blast
=====
The best graphics engine in the whole fekkin world (not really)

How to use this
---------------
First of all, you need to set yourself up. Then use it so that it works for you.

How to set up?
--------------
1. Download [CMake][cmake].
2. `git clone git://github.com/evoL/blast.git`
3. `cd blast`
4. `git submodule init`  
5. `git submodule update`  
6. Use the CMake GUI and point both directories it asks at the `blast` directory. Or do it the UNIX way and just type `cmake .`.
7. Build using your dev tools. On Windows we use VS2008, on Mac Xcode and on Linux we just use `make`.
8. Do something awesome (unless it doesn't work)!
